66] ubuntu root password - CackJow8
67] Cretaing new certificate

Below are the steps which we require to create a new VPN certificate for the user

1) login to tech vlan machine
2) launch chrome and open the link below as per the site. The below link is for the montreal site
http://mtlopenvpn2/openvpn/index.php?Action=ViewCertificate&id=0644

3) click on new certificate and find the user
check the user's details in that list

4)To revoke the older certificates

login to openvpn server(site specific) with the ubuntu root password
ssh root@mtlopenvpn2

Use the below command to revoke the old certificate
/etc/openvpn/revoke_user sapm

where sapm is the username

or

cd /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa
. ./vars
./revoke-full 00D

5)To revoke qr code
vpnutil --user sapm --revoke

Till now we have revoked the old QR code and the old certificate

You can confirm the same by going to the list and besides the user name under certificates column it will be displayed as "revoked"

6)After the above steps open the link  http://mtlopenvpn2/openvpn/index.php?Action=ViewCertificate&id=0644 to create the new certificate
click on the new certificate and enter the user details. Make sure all the details are properly filled

7)click on Make
The new VPN certificate for the user will be ready for the user with a different entry.

8) Now send the new QR code and VPN setup to the user and add hi in the new starters group so that he can download the VPN setup from the drive.

79] Show aliases Autosync
"cva-creature-prodsupes-lon" alias is Autosynced Show alias, hence if we add/remove any member manually, then the changes will get reverted back automatically.The automated alias script uses the shotgun project user connection fields 'Show Role' and 'Department'.

Project user connections are created when users are linked to a shotgun project. So you need to update 'Show Role' and 'Department' in Shotgun. Also verify you've correctly added to the CS in order to make the link to the show effective.

Kindly refer the below dnet page for more information.

86] License key update repo in git
http://stash/projects/TECH/repos/licenses/browse

87] The process on the DNET page is a bit outdated, as it was last modified back in 2020.

The current procedure in place is to have the requester answer the following survey below:

1] What service needs to be enabled?
2] Why the service needs to be enabled?
3] Are they using a DNEG device? This is important if data download features are requested!
4] The business justification for enabling the service.
5] Who will be using the service?
Please note that permissions will be restricted to company encrypted MacBooks or approved MacMini's for those who will need to drive and record sessions.

The most important bit is to make sure that the requester is using Zoom off a DNEG encrypted device.
Once the relevant information is supplied, we then give Zoom recording permissions to the user!

Cheers,

Lisa

120] zoom encryption decryption
There are multiple ways which could be affecting zoom encryption issue

The user you're messaging has to be online at the same time as you to encrypt the messages.

For the users to whom you are unable to see the chats, please ask them to update to latest version of zoom and check.
and for the group chats which you have mentioned please check on another device(if you have logged in) if those messages are decrypted or not.

You can also try to log into the website, zoom.us, with your account and there should be a setting to "Sign out of all devices"
as having the account signed into multiple places can confuse it as well.

Log into zoom.us via browser
Click the Profile menu on the top left > scroll down to 'Linked accounts' then click 'sign me out from all devices'.
Then sign in on the laptop and check if messages are still encrypted .

You can also install/update to the latest version of the zoom.

Thanks!!

From vcenter, turn off vm> edit settings > for hard disk 1, change the size Eg: 250 GB

Note: in mtl we've been setting windows vms to 1000gb for both the main and user_data drives. make sure to change the size of the existing drive, dont delete and remake the drive because they'll lose their data!

-once thats done ,boot the vm and login. install easeus partition manager:
/dist/dist/epm.exe

-run partition manager. ignore popup out 'new disk guide'. now there's an unallocated partition under 'disk 0', but it's next to 'recovery'. we need to move it so it's adjacent to the partition we want to expand (c). right click the recovery partition > resize/move > set available after to 0 mb and then click ok and execute the operation from the top left.
now you can expand c partition, right click 'c' > resize/move > set the allocated to 250 GB and click ok and then execute the operation.

150] Shared drive with clients.
Please confirm if you meet the following requirements so that we can proceed further with this.

Client authorization and approval that Drive can be used as a data repository and collaboration platform is required before creating the shared Drive. This can either be a contractual line item or can be authorized by a FTE (client/third-party) or sufficient seniority who has authority to grant permission.
A valid signed NDA is in effect between the company and the client/third-party.
Client domains must be provided so that they can whitelisted as any other domains are restricted.
How much long share drive will need
No shared drives will be provisioned, nor access provided until a valid NDA and client authorization and approval have been demonstrated.
Only Data IO must transfer data uploaded to Shared Drives onto the Production and Corporate networks. Established Data IO data integrity checking processes will assist in mitigating the risks associated with malware propagation, copyright infringement and the download of unauthorized software.
No data should ever be downloaded from shared drives to personally owned laptops, desktops and mobile devices, etc.
