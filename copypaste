Can you please let us know,
Does that alias is going to receive mails from external users/clients

Thanks
Venkat
##########################
Those aliases are Autosynced Show aliases,
hence if we add/remove any member manually, then the changes will get reverted back automatically.
The automated alias script uses the shotgun project user connection fields 'Show Role' and 'Department'.
Project user connections are created when users are linked to a shotgun project.
So you need to update 'Show Role' and 'Department' in Shotgun.
Also verify you've correctly added to the CS in order to make the link to the show effective.
Kindly refer to the below dnet page for more information.

(NOTE: Recording is restricted to DNEG imaged Macbooks & Mac Mini's)

user Display name change
1) Since the name gets synced from Workday, an initial request needs to be raised with HR team for name change in the Workday.

2) As we have switched now over to Zoom SSO all the data will be fetched from IMS. To change your name in zoom you will need to create a ticket with IMS team emailing to imssupport@dneg.com to update your name in the GED database.

3) Lastly, the VPN certificates need to be revoked and once the changes are reflected, a new QR code will be provided to you from us.

We can do this for you, just wanted to make you aware that with this process, we will also need to delete your VPN certificate and reinstate it which does take some time to sync.

Thanks
Venkat
