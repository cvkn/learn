to update the aliases or any configuration file in the systems we use git/stash

we have to pull the repositary from stash site

for first time setup we need to copy the ssh key to the user in stash web-application

#vim ~/.ssh/cvkr_dneg.pub copy the text in this file 

copy the ssh-rsa key and paste it in the stash website

by using the command also you can copy the text in that file #xclip -selection clipboard < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

website route was --> chrome--> stash/ --> login --> settings --> users --> cvkr --> SSHKEYS tab -->  add keys --> paste the text copied from /.ssh/cvkr_dneg.pub

then we are ready to use the bitbucket

next 

make a dir with name git in user homedir

#mkdir ~/git

#cd ~/git

#git clone <repo link in ssh format> 	 Ex: git clone ssh://git@stash/tech/site-tech.git

it will create cloned repo in you git dir

#git pull		to download the latest repositaries from git

make changes whichever necessary 

#git diff		to view and confirm the changes we made in the files or repo's

#git push		to upload the data to the servers to intigrate them in git
