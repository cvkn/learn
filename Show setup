2.Job setup

# jobssetup -j P30RE --div VFX --org DNEG

Some errors will occur while executing this command we need to retry till it gives the desired output
Ref:http://dnet.dneg.com/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=TECH&title=New+Show+Creation+Procedure

Show setup was completed in london site

3.Syncronize the created show to desired site


Show setup was completed in london site
but we need to sync the show to requied site also
while running the jobsetup command we can create a PR for making changes in sitedata file

# git branch --> it will show the default branch
# git checkout master --> it will change the default to master branch
	(we should only create branches from master)
# git pull --> to refresh the repo
# git checkout -b hotfix/Add_showname_in_Mum
# cd showname
# vim sitedata.yaml
	(every show must be added in global shows)
	(every show must be added in desired site)
	(every show need to insert in show-secure & show-sync)
	(every show must be added in alphabetical order only)
	-->save the file after editing
# git diff
# git commmit -m "comment for adding show with ticket number" sitedata.yaml
# stash-review --> it will generate a PR-URL copy it and ask for approval in CST thrugh the URL,
					(it needs to approved by two people)
	After approval it need to be mergerd with master file,(Ask in Tech global for PR Merge)

4.need to wait till jenkins sync to be completed, (jenkin Url's available in DNET Page)

5.cross check for confirmation with /jobs/showname --> directories should be there

6.we need to sync the setup manually also for cross check

# sync_util -j showname -s lon -d site

7. Lastly we need to update the epic ticket for changing the status of all linked tickets

# update_showsetup_epic --unstall-ptsup-tickets <epic_ticket_id> it is available on ticket page,


8 need to provide the google drive setup with the required directory hierarchy & content manager access for users

#dnvault

open remote site of show,
open chrome login with drive credentials,
open drive
create directory with show code
sub directories as required,
